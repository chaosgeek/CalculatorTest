# CalculatorTest
For ebay test
You will need a robotium JAR file, but don’t worry, I have offered you in the “libs” folder, you just need to add as an external JAR to the project.
I use the third part avd named Genymotion, avd running speed effect the latency time of test scripts.
May be you need to re-sign the Calculator apk file, but if you compile the app and run the test scripts at the same computer, it is not need.
